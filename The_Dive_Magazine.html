					<h2>Trump Tweets From Sidelines</h2>
					<img id="headlineImage" src="multimedia/trump.jpg" alt="Headline Image here">
					<p id=newsPara>
						When a frustrated President Trump called on Tuesday for a shutdown of the government and an end to the legislative filibuster in the Senate, the response from lawmakers in his own party was swift, and final: No.
						“That will not happen,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
						“It’s important we govern, and not just shut down the government,” said Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas.
						“I wish he’d think twice before he tweeted,” said Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
						Trump is a president who dreamed big: of beautiful border walls, of repealing a popular health care law that has added around 20 million to insurance rolls and replacing it with something terrific, of major cuts to domestic spending, of massive boosts to the military. He promised to remake the country in a new—and very, very great—image.
						But over the first three months of his presidency, Trump has struggled to grapple the realities of governing. The legislative process is arduous and slow, governed by rules and compromise, not by executive fiat. More than 103 days into his tenure, Trump has little to show for his negotiating skills and business acumen.
						Instead, Trump has managed to stir up the ire of members of his own party and shown himself to largely be a sideshow in many of the battles in Washington. He has become a gadfly, tweeting from the bench.
						"I do wish somebody would take his iPhone away from him,” Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee told reporters.
